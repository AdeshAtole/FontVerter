# FontVerter
Java library for converting fonts. Currently only supports bare CFF to OpenType/OTF (CFF flavored). (Bare CFFs are found in PDF files and can be used as an OTF's CFF table with extra conversion work)

Planning OTF -> WOFF and java shape objects -> OTF glyphs next

No JavaDocs. (see uncle Bob's explanation: http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1327761)
